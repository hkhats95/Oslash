# Twitter API project

#####This application allows data from three user roles:
1. Twitter Users: Generic user account
  * Users signup and generate content independently on the platform in the form of tweets.
2. Admin: Internal employee account of twitter
  * Admins can monitor/modify any data generated by said users'.
3. Super-Admin: Internal employee with critical data access
  * Each modification by an admin is followed by a verification/approval from the super-admin.
  * Super-admin can perform analytics queries and generate insights from user behavior.
  

#####APIs for the user, admin and super-admin perform following functions.

**For Admin:**

2. Initiate CRUD of tweets on users' behalf
**For Super-Admin:**

3. Write custom queries to generate insights
  Examples:
